# Static analysis tools for Android
We're going to take a look into the most popular  static code analysis tools that you can use to implement and enforce custom rules in your codebase. Some of the benefits of using a linter are: enforce standards programmatically, automate code quality and code maintenance.

You can write your own rules by using these tools:
- Android Lint API
- ktlint
- detekt

We'll describe the step by step process to write some rules on this demo project. You can check the whole process here:
